# Ourbronx

OurBronx is a community hub that aims to spread awareness about community issues and initiatives via local events and community boards, and empowers residents to team up with organizations and public officials to create community projects. We also crowdsource scholarships for Bronx residents to participate in tech or arts programs or fund their community projects.
